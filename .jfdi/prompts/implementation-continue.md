Your implementation session is being continued: the work you
submitted did not clear the pipeline. Address the feedback below, then finish the same
way as before.

## What happened

{{FEEDBACK}}

## Rules (unchanged from your original instructions)

- Address every item.
- Do NOT run the mechanical gate — the pipeline runs it for you after your session
  ends, and a failure comes straight back to you as feedback. These are the checks
  your work will face:
{{GATE_COMMANDS}}
- This session has no auto-format hook: before finishing, format the files you
  touched with `pnpm exec biome check --write <files>`.
- If you touched `docs/coding-guidelines.md` or `docs/jfdi-operations.md`, run
  `pnpm sync:guidelines` — never hand-edit the generated modules.
- Stay inside this worktree; touch no branch other than `{{BRANCH}}`.

## Reporting your result (required)

When you are finished, write a single JSON object to the file at:

{{VERDICT_PATH}}

Your outcome is read only from this file — write it as your final action.
Its exact schema is described below. Do not wrap it in markdown.

Schema (same as your previous verdict):
{
  "status": "done" | "escalate",
  "summary": "one-paragraph summary of what you changed this round",
  "decisions": ["autonomous choice you made and why", ...],
  "observations": ["out-of-scope issue worth its own ticket — never fixed inline", ...],
  "question": "only when escalating: the precise question",
  "recommendation": "only when escalating: your recommended answer"
}
